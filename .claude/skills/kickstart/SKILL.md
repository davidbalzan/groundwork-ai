# Kickstart - Project Initialization Wizard

Initialize a new project with the complete ForgeKit documentation structure. This skill guides you through setting up all foundational documents for a well-organized, AI-friendly project.

## Obsidian Format (Required)

All generated files under `docs/` live in an Obsidian vault. Every generated file MUST:

1. **Start with YAML frontmatter:**
   ```yaml
   ---
   title: "Descriptive Title"
   tags: [forgekit/core] # or forgekit/reference, forgekit/phase, forgekit/template
   aliases: ["Short Name"]
   ---
   ```
2. **Use `[[wikilinks]]` for cross-references**, not `[text](path.md)`. Examples:
   - `[[DECISIONS]]` — link by filename
   - `[[CURRENT_FOCUS|Current Focus]]` — custom display text
   - `[[DECISIONS#adr-001-monorepo|ADR-001]]` — link to heading
3. **Templates already have frontmatter and wikilinks.** When copying a template, preserve the frontmatter (update title/aliases to match the project) and keep the wikilinks as-is.

## Instructions

Follow this guided flow to set up a new project from scratch.

### Stage 1: Project Setup

First, gather basic information:

1. **Project name** - What's the project called?
2. **Project type** - Web app, API, CLI, library, mobile, etc.
3. **Brief description** - One sentence about what it does

Then create the folder structure:

```
project-root/
├── docs/
│   ├── phases/
│   │   └── templates/
│   └── templates/
├── client/src/          # If frontend needed
└── server/src/          # If backend needed
```

### Stage 2: Tech Stack Discovery

Ask about each layer (skip if not applicable):

**Frontend:**

- Framework? (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.)
- Build tool? (Vite, Next.js, etc.)
- Styling? (Tailwind, CSS-in-JS, etc.)
- State management? (Zustand, Redux, etc.)

**Backend:**

- Runtime? (Node.js, Deno, Bun, Python, Go, etc.)
- Framework? (Hono, Express, FastAPI, etc.)
- Database? (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, etc.)
- ORM? (Drizzle, Prisma, SQLAlchemy, etc.)

**Infrastructure:**

- Package manager? (pnpm, npm, yarn)
- Monorepo? (Yes/No)
- Deployment target? (Vercel, AWS, Docker, etc.)

Generate `docs/TECH_STACK.md` using `docs/templates/TECH_STACK_TEMPLATE.md` as the structure. Fill in the placeholders with the collected information.

### Stage 3: Architecture Decisions

For each major technology choice, ask:

1. **Why this choice?** - Rationale for the decision
2. **What alternatives were considered?** - Other options evaluated
3. **What are the trade-offs?** - Pros and cons

Generate using the corresponding templates in `docs/templates/`:

- `docs/ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md` - from `ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE_TEMPLATE.md`
- `docs/DECISIONS.md` - Initial ADRs for key choices (use existing DECISIONS.md ADR template section as structure)

### Stage 4: Project Phases

Ask about the project scope:

1. **What's the MVP?** - Minimum viable product scope
2. **What comes after MVP?** - Future phases
3. **Any hard deadlines?** - Timeline constraints

Suggest a phase structure based on project type:

**Typical Web App Phases:**

```
Phase 1: Foundation (Setup, Auth, Core UI)
Phase 2: Core Features (Main functionality)
Phase 3: Polish (UX, Performance, Testing)
Phase 4: Launch (Deployment, Monitoring)
```

**Typical API Phases:**

```
Phase 1: Foundation (Setup, Database, Core Endpoints)
Phase 2: Security (Auth, Rate Limiting, Validation)
Phase 3: Features (Business Logic, Integrations)
Phase 4: Production (Monitoring, Docs, Deployment)
```

Generate using the corresponding templates in `docs/templates/`:

- `docs/PRODUCTION_ROADMAP.md` - from `PRODUCTION_ROADMAP_TEMPLATE.md`
- `docs/phases/README.md` - from `PHASES_README_TEMPLATE.md`
- `docs/phases/phase1/README.md` - from `PHASE_README_TEMPLATE.md`

### Stage 5: Initialize Focus

Set up the current focus document:

- Point to Phase 1 as the starting point
- Note any immediate next steps
- Leave session notes empty for first session

Generate `docs/CURRENT_FOCUS.md`.

### Stage 6: Design System (Optional)

If the project has a frontend, ask:

1. **Color scheme?** - Primary, secondary, accent colors
2. **Typography?** - Font family preferences
3. **Component style?** - Minimal, modern, playful, corporate

Generate `docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` from `docs/templates/DESIGN_SYSTEM_TEMPLATE.md` if applicable.

### Stage 7: Summary & Next Steps

Provide a summary of everything created:

```markdown
## Project Initialized: [Project Name]

### Files Created

- docs/TECH_STACK.md
- docs/ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md
- docs/DECISIONS.md
- docs/PRODUCTION_ROADMAP.md
- docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md (if frontend)
- docs/phases/README.md
- docs/phases/phase1/README.md
- docs/phases/templates/TASK_TEMPLATE.md
- docs/phases/templates/task_template_prompt.md
- docs/templates/PRD_TEMPLATE.md
- docs/CURRENT_FOCUS.md

### Next Steps

1. Run `/create-prd` to define detailed requirements
2. Run `/plan-phase 1 [Phase Name]` to create detailed tasks
3. Run `/start-session` to begin development
```

## Conversation Flow

```
1. Greet and explain the kickstart process
2. Stage 1: Gather project basics, create structure
3. Stage 2: Tech stack discovery → TECH_STACK.md
4. Stage 3: Architecture decisions → ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md, DECISIONS.md
5. Stage 4: Define phases → PRODUCTION_ROADMAP.md, phases/
6. Stage 5: Initialize focus → docs/CURRENT_FOCUS.md
7. Stage 6: Design system (if frontend) → DESIGN_SYSTEM.md
8. Stage 7: Summary and next steps
```

## Logging Convention (Inherited from Template)

Every project derived from ForgeKit ships with structured logging out of the box:

- **Server (`apps/api`)**: pino writes NDJSON to console **and** `logs/api.log` at the repo root.
- **Browser (`apps/web`)**: a tiny logger in `apps/web/src/logger.ts` mirrors to `console` and POSTs batched entries to `/api/logs`, which pino re-emits with `source: "client"`.
- **Result**: a single file (`logs/api.log`) captures both sides, ideal for `tail -f` by humans or AI agents.
- `LOG_LEVEL` env var controls verbosity (default `info`).

When generating `ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md` or initial ADRs, mention this convention so it's not silently lost as the project evolves. If the user picks a different stack (Python/Go/etc.), adapt the same pattern: structured logs to file + console, browser logs forwarded server-side, single tailable file.

## Tips

- **Start lean**: You can always add more detail later
- **Capture decisions early**: Future you will thank you
- **Don't overthink phases**: They can be adjusted as you learn
- **Link documents**: Cross-reference between docs for navigation

## Related Skills

After kickstart, use these in order:

1. `/create-prd` - Define detailed product requirements
2. `/plan-phase 1 [name]` - Create Phase 1 task breakdown
3. `/start-session` - Begin your first coding session
4. `/log-decision` - Record decisions as you make them
